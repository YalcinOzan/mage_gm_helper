# Mage: The Ascension - GM Helper

I built this web-based tool to help Storytellers and players with **Mage: The Ascension** mechanics.

Calculating Arete rolls and tracking extended rituals can sometimes slow down the game. I created this helper to handle the math instantly so we can focus on the roleplay.

**Use the tool here:** https://yalcinozan.github.io/mage_gm_helper/

## What does it do?

* **Ritualmatic:** Tracks accumulated successes for extended rituals, which is usually a hassle to track on paper.
